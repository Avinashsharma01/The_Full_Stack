The **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** is an official, opinionated library from the Redux team designed to simplify the process of writing Redux logic. It eliminates boilerplate code and provides utilities to implement Redux features efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step guide to learning and using Redux Toolkit:

---

## **1. What is Redux Toolkit?**

RTK is built to simplify common Redux tasks:

-   Setting up a Redux store.
-   Creating reducers and actions.
-   Handling immutable state updates.
-   Writing complex middleware logic.

Key features include:

-   **`configureStore()`**: Simplifies store creation with sensible defaults.
-   **`createSlice()`**: Combines reducers and actions in a single function.
-   **`createAsyncThunk()`**: Simplifies handling async actions like API calls.
-   **Middleware**: Built-in support for commonly used middleware like `redux-thunk`.

---

## **2. Setting up a Redux Toolkit Project**

### Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Project Structure:

```plaintext
src/
  app/
    store.js         # Redux store setup
  features/
    counter/         # Example feature slice
      counterSlice.js
  App.js
  index.js
```

---

## **3. Creating the Redux Store**

Use **`configureStore`** to set up the store with preconfigured middleware and DevTools enabled by default.

### Example (`src/app/store.js`):

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        counter: counterReducer, // Add slices here
    },
});
```

---

## **4. Writing a Slice**

Use **`createSlice`** to create a reducer and associated actions in one step.

### Example (`src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`):

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: "counter",
    initialState: {
        value: 0,
    },
    reducers: {
        increment: (state) => {
            state.value += 1; // Immer makes this mutation safe
        },
        decrement: (state) => {
            state.value -= 1;
        },
        incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
            state.value += action.payload;
        },
    },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

## **5. Connecting React Components**

Wrap your app in a **`Provider`** and use **`useSelector`** and **`useDispatch`** hooks for state and actions.

### `index.js`:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./app/store";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>
);
```

### `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import {
    increment,
    decrement,
    incrementByAmount,
} from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

function App() {
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementByAmount(5))}>
                Increment by 5
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

---

## **6. Handling Asynchronous Actions**

Use **`createAsyncThunk`** for async actions like API calls.

### Example (`features/counter/counterSlice.js`):

```javascript
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Async thunk
export const fetchCounter = createAsyncThunk(
    "counter/fetchCounter",
    async () => {
        const response = await fetch("/api/counter");
        const data = await response.json();
        return data.value;
    }
);

const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: "counter",
    initialState: {
        value: 0,
        status: "idle",
    },
    reducers: {
        increment: (state) => {
            state.value += 1;
        },
        decrement: (state) => {
            state.value -= 1;
        },
    },
    extraReducers: (builder) => {
        builder
            .addCase(fetchCounter.pending, (state) => {
                state.status = "loading";
            })
            .addCase(fetchCounter.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
                state.status = "succeeded";
                state.value = action.payload;
            })
            .addCase(fetchCounter.rejected, (state) => {
                state.status = "failed";
            });
    },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

## **7. Middleware and DevTools**

RTK automatically adds `redux-thunk` middleware. You can customize middleware using the `middleware` option in `configureStore`:

```javascript
import logger from "redux-logger";
const store = configureStore({
    reducer: { counter: counterReducer },
    middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger),
});
```

---

## **8. Best Practices**

-   **Slice per feature**: Each feature of your app should have its slice.
-   **Keep async logic in thunks**: Use `createAsyncThunk` for API calls or async operations.
-   **Use the Redux DevTools**: Debug state changes easily with preconfigured DevTools support.
